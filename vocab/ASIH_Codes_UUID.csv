The collection has continued to grow in size, scope, and importance since its founding. The collection is taxonomically diverse, but its especially strong among eels, characiforms and catfish. Its geographic scope is world-wide, but it's strengths include freshwater species of North and South America and marine species of the Bahamas, Western Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Continued growth results from recent expeditions to the Bahamas, South America and Asia."

Particularly strong are collections from all over Alabama and Georgia. These collections include some of the few major collections from the southeastern United States made prior to 1950. Also included are specimens of most fish species of the United States and a significant collection of marine fishes from the Gulf of Mexico. The fish collection also includes a strong Neotropical fish collection from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. There are also significant collections from Africa and Southeast Asia. The collection is currently 100% computerized. "

The primary emphasis of the collection is tropical coral-reef fishes within the Indo-Pacific, but it also includes material from pelagic and deep-sea environments. The collection includes a few freshwater fishes, mostly from rivers and streams in the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere in Oceania. The collection is fully digitized, with complete and annotated records for all specimens entered in the database, and many of the film images scanned. The fish collection represents the bulk of the lifetime work of Dr. John E. Randall, Senior Ichthyologist (now Emeritus), who began working in the collection in 1965 and a half-century later continues to publish on fish systematics and biogeography. Dr. Richard L. Pyle continues to add to the collection, with an emphasis on collecting specimens from deep coral-reef ecosystems (so-called “Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems”, or the Coral-Reef “Twilight Zone”), using advanced diving technology."

The strengths of its holdings lie principally in marine fishes of the western and central Pacific, especially California, as well as freshwater fishes from South America and southeastern Asia. To further support marine research and the wider ichthyology community, we also house older historic collections from North America and a large number of type specimens."

CUMV Fish Collection was established shortly after the founding of the university in 1865. Many of the earliest specimens were collected by well known researchers such as David Starr Jordan, Carl Eigenmann, Charles Frederick Hartt and Seth Meek. Although there is worldwide representation of both marine and freshwater species, the bulk of the collection is strongly representative of freshwater fishes from eastern North America and has formed the basis for numerous systematic works on the North American fish fauna. Much of the material is in large geographic series, and many sites have been sampled repeatedly through extended periods of time. Some specimens are from the original New York State Biological Survey (1926-39). Many of the collections are from the highly industrialized Northeast and Middle Atlantic states and thus document earlier faunas in habitats now greatly altered, and there are repeated samples through time from many of these localities.

This emphasis on the collection and research of freshwater and marine fishes has made The Field Museum a leader in the evolutionary biology of fishes.
Seth E. Meek (1897-1914) pioneered the study of Neotropical freshwater fishes. Loren P. Woods (1941-1978) amassed large and important collections of freshwater fishes from North America and marine fishes from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. Robert K. Johnson (1972-1986) obtained significant collections of mesopelagic fishes and shorefishes from Belize and Honduras amounting to more than 100,000 specimens. Donald J. Stewart (1978-1985), Barry Chernoff (1987-2002), and later Assistant Collection Manager Phil Willink (2002-2010) rejuvenated our early Neotropical freshwater research and collection emphasis by conducting numerous expeditions to Ecuador, Peru, Surinam, and Venezuela. Since his arrival, Mark Westneat (1991-2013) expanded the marine collections, focusing on Indo-Pacific coral reef fishes. Leo Smith (2007-2013) strengthened the midwater and deep-sea collections from both sides of the north Pacific Ocean. Caleb McMahan (2014-present) works on growth of the Neotropical collections."

Early collections focused on fishes of the upper Midwest, especially fishes of Minnesota. However, there are many older collections from outside the state. These include specimens from the Menage expedition to the Phillipines in the 1890s; fish from Hawaii collected in the early 1900s; and many other specimens from across the continental United States. The fish collection also holds diverse holdings of marine fishes from the Pacific Northwest, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic coast. While most of the specimens are stored in alcohol there is: a large collection of pharyngeal teeth from cyprinids and catostomids; a sizable, uncataloged larval fish collection; and a growing collection of dry and stained-and-cleared skeletal material."

By the late 1700s, William Dandridge Peck, the first professor of Natural History at Harvard, had collected and published on New England fishes. Peck's specimens were skinned, dried and glued to paper sheets; some are still in the MCZ collection to this day. After the MCZ was founded by Louis Agassiz, the fish collection grew rapidly and has had a long history of active ichthyological research. Today, the Ichthyological Collection remains one of the best in the world and emphasis is placed on teaching with very active undergraduate and graduate student research programs. The fish collection has been fully renovated and its holdings are available for search on the web."

Of the freshwater holdings, more than half are from Michigan, among them 1,100 specimens collected from the Red Cedar River, which flows through campus. Additional noteworthy series were collected in Ecuador, Mexico, and India. Both fluid-preserved specimens and skeletons (over 1,200) are represented."

The significance of this collection is not only restricted to the fishes of the Southeast, but in fact contains thousands of specimens from across the United States and the world. Specimens housed in the collection date back to 1869, though the majority of early collections did not occur until the 1940’s. These collections were made by early curators, Dr. Joseph Bailey of Duke University, as well as the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, and provide a valuable snapshot of the historical distribution of North Carolina fish biodiversity. The collection is not only an important archive of historical information, but has also grown tremendously in recent years. Particularly notable are the marine specimens. These include a large collection of Atlantic and Shortnose Sturgeons, deep-sea fishes from the Atlantic and Gulf, and an excellent collection of Western Atlantic eel larvae. While most of the ichthyology collection comprises fluid preserved specimens, it also houses skeletal materials representative of many freshwater and marine species that have been used in anatomical, zooarcheological, and paleontological research. In addition, the collection contains an actively growing collection of ethanol preserved tissues for DNA studies."

One of the collection’s greatest strengths is an extensive sample of species from the lower Great Plains, particularly from Oklahoma streams and reservoirs. Under the direction of A. I. Ortenburger, specimens were collected during expeditions in the 1920s. Other periods of extensive collecting include the 1950s, 1960s and 1980s. The collection grew during the 1990s thanks to area conservationist Jimmie Pigg and during the early 2000s due to the efforts of the Department of Environmental Quality who continued Pigg’s work. The availability of these long-term samples of specimens from statewide sites provides an important opportunity to assess natural variation in fish communities. The collection continues to add to the collection’s geographic diversity through ongoing research conducted by curators, professional staff, students and associates."

The collection is comprehensive for freshwater species from Oregon and extensive for North Pacific species. The collection includes more far-flung specimens from Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Guyana, Hawaii, India, Japan, Lake Baikal, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, Trinidad and Zambia. The collection also holds a rare series of freshwater fishes from Iran, which formed the basis of Neil Armantrout’s doctoral dissertation in 1980 and supported the development of an online identification guide to Iranian fishes.

Officially recognized in 1895, the fish collections grew and moved successively from the attic of the Botany and Zoology Building, OSU's Biological Station at Cedar Point, Ohio State Historical Society, Franz Theodore Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island, the basement of Sullivant Hall, to the current location at 1315 Kinnear Road in the Museum of Biological Diversity. The fish collections are primarily used as a resource for systematics research and publication, laboratory teaching at the university level and for public education. In addition, they are also used as a basis for comparative studies, geographic range information, ecological assessments and environmental impact statements. Voucher specimens are deposited with the collection by a number of researchers and agencies to anchor reports and publications."

James Morrow, Ron Smith, and several other University of Alaska researchers established and built the nucleus of the collection. Most of the data associated with both collections are in the Arctos database, however a significant number of records for marine invertebrates housed in the museum’s collections remain to be incorporated into this electronic resource."
