The primary emphasis of the collection is tropical coral-reef fishes within the Indo-Pacific, but it also includes material from pelagic and deep-sea environments. The collection includes a few freshwater fishes, mostly from rivers and streams in the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere in Oceania. The collection is fully digitized, with complete and annotated records for all specimens entered in the database, and many of the film images scanned. The fish collection represents the bulk of the lifetime work of Dr. John E. Randall, Senior Ichthyologist (now Emeritus), who began working in the collection in 1965 and a half-century later continues to publish on fish systematics and biogeography. Dr. Richard L. Pyle continues to add to the collection, with an emphasis on collecting specimens from deep coral-reef ecosystems (so-called Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems, or the Coral-Reef Twilight Zone), using advanced diving technology."
